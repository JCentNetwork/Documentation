#   JCent Protocol  

## Abstract
This paper will describe a new decentralized interest bearing stable currency protocol. Users can share the profits brought by the system's lending function by holding the system's native token, and can participate in community governance to make the system more decentralized.


## JCent Protocol Overview

Jcent protocol is an innovative experimental stable currency protocol. Users can use JCent approved assets as collateral to generate stable currency JUSD. Second, JCent protocol maintains a decentralized JEN native asset pool. The assets of the asset pool belong to the protocol itself. Users can borrow just from this pool, and the lending process is implemented by JCent DAO management, the income generated is owned by the entire JCent protocol, and the income distribution is managed by JCent DAO, and is organized and operated by the community.

Jcent protocol is a kind of encryption protocol similar to MakerDao and JST. The biggest innovation of JCent is that JCent maintains a decentralized native asset pool, which is owned by all JEN holders and managed by the JEN holder community.

However, only stable currency assets mapped by JEN can be lent from JEN pool. Users use a certain proportion of assets as collateral. If JEN drops, the system will clear the user's collateral and destroy the JUSD Lended. Therefore, just can maintain a 1:1 stability with the value of US dollars.

## Stable Coin JUSD

The stable currency JUSD is an asset-backed cryptocurrency that anchors the US dollar. Its issuance is decentralized and managed by JCent DAO.

JUSD is generated and issued by JCent protocol. Users can issue a certain proportion of just as long as they mortgage enough assets as security. In order to keep the JUSD value equal to the US dollar, users need to over mortgage certain digital assets.

The JCent protocol maintains a certain proportion of native assets issued from the system asset pool. Users can borrow JUSD from this pool.


## Token Distribution

The JCent protocol token is JEN, with a total amount of 1000000 and will never be issued.

Initial market 10%

Staking mining 20%

System asset pool 30%

Operation team 10%

Development team 30%


## Governance

JCent governance is entirely up to the JEN holder. However, in the early stage, we will reserve some permissions to help JCent protocol run stably. After it is completely stable, the ownership of all JEN protocol contracts will be transferred to the time locked governance contract or completely deleted. To ensure that JCent is a reference implementation of a truly decentralized protocol.


## Vision

JCent is committed to creating an innovative stable currency agreement, a stable currency that truly belongs to the community. Together, JCent holds JEN and participates in governance to open up a better decentralized future.ã€‚
